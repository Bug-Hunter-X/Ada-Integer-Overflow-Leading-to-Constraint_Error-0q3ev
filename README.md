This repository demonstrates an uncommon Ada coding error: an Integer overflow leading to a Constraint_Error exception. The `bug.ada` file contains code that causes this error, while `bugSolution.ada` shows how to fix the issue by using a larger data type such as Long_Integer, or by implementing checks to prevent overflow.  The error highlights the importance of careful consideration of data types when working with numbers that might exceed the capacity of a standard Integer type in Ada.
